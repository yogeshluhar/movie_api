# movie_api (Flutter)
A Flutter-based movie app with a responsive UI will work on mobile, tablet, and laptop devices. It will use a fake API to fetch movie data, allowing users to search by title, genre, or release year. The app will display movie posters, titles, summaries, and other details, with a clean design and smooth navigation across platforms.
